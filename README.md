## How to Start Project
Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   ```
2. **Install Anaconda:**
   
   Make sure you have Anaconda installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
   
4. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   
   Create a new virtual environment using Python 3.9.6:

   ```bash
   conda create --name your_env_name python=3.9.6 -y
   ```
   Replace your_env_name with the desired name for your virtual environment.

   or

   If you don't want to install anaconda then you can run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv your_env_name
   ```
   Here you don't have the privilege to choose the python version. It will choose the default version on your computer.
   
   Activate the newly created environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate your_env_name
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   source your_env_name/bin/activate
   ```
   This command is for those who haven't created the environment using Anaconda.
5. **Install Dependencies:**
   
   Install the project dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

6. **Configure Your Gemini API Key:**

   You need to create .env file in your project's root directory in which you are supposed add your own Gemini API key in the following manner:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"
   ```

7. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   This command will start the Streamlit app.

For the lazy individuals like me just run the following command:
   ```bash
   bash init_setup.sh
   ```
It'll perform all the steps for you except the last two steps. Isn't it good?
